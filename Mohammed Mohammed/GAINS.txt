f_infiltrationRaster.py  script needs most of these data be inputs as raster data inside the geodatabase named (Infiltration.gdb):
 Inputs:-
        
        duration; time for run in hrs.
	p; precipitation should be eneterd in the  form described in the script.
	to; initail time with zero value-(Raster)
	watermask3= 0 if the vegetation is deciduous, 1 if the vegetation is miscellaneous (grass), and 2 if no vegetation (bare)-(Raster)
  	wp; water content at willting point as percent-(Raster)
	Et0; mean evapotraspiration in cm/hr for first vegetation zone for a specific month-(Raster)
	Et1; mean evapotraspiration in cm/hr for second vegetation zone for a specific month-(Raster)
	Et2; mean evaporation in cm/hr for non-vegetation zone for a specific month-(Raster)
	minElevation; optional lowest point at the wetland in meter
	maxElevation; optional highest point of pour point in meter
	phead, pressure head at the front view-(Raster)
	ks; hydraulic conductivity cm/hr-(Raster)
	wci; initail water content-(Raster)
	wcs; water content at saturation-(Raster)
	fc; water content at field capacity-(Raster)
	
Outputs:-
     Raster maps for infiltration rate in cm/hr inside the geodata file
     Many other raster maps necessary to process the infiltration rate
